- Levels
	- introduce spikes- force a particular rotation
	- tricky platforming back and forth w/ spikes
	- something where you can't just put them together because of a protrusion
	- T, U
	- More rotate
	- 69
- Fixes
	- Zoom (when in outside mode?) to encompass both blocks
	- remember to add different colors to all level blocks
- Extra polish
	- Level end transition (show block faces?)
	- Organic looking decorations for inside
	- Improve music loop
	- Disable controls when level ending?
	- Blocks look at each other
	- Backgrounds
	- Blocks wobble when grabbed
	- Round corners of block guys' colliders for better dragging
	- Particles
	- Beating hearts
- Lerp everything for polish
	- block faces fade in/out
	- block position dragging/rotating
		- slide around more
